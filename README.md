# LazyMe
After some time spent on various actions to install different cloud providers, I decided it could be done way easier.
So LazyMe would do the following:
1. Speech recognition
2. validate provided credentials
3. GenAI requests to get list of commands to execute
4. validate PC hardware requirements or deploys a VM.
5. install requirements
6. ssh to the machine and run those commands
7. If there will be any issues during the execution -> goes to step 2 in attempt to fix it
8. Sound/Print the result
